# Rag_Agent
This project is a PDF-based RAG chatbot built using LangGraph and OpenAI GPT-4o. It reads a stock market PDF, stores it in a Chroma vector database, and uses a retriever tool to answer user questions with relevant document chunks. The chatbot interacts intelligently, calling tools only when needed to provide accurate, source-backed answers.
